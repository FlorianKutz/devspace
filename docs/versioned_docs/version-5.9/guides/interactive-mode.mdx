:::warning Deprecation of interactive mode
Using `devspace dev -i` is deprecated, and the flag will be removed in the future! Make sure to change your `devspace.yaml`'s to have an `interactive` mode profile instead:

```yaml
...
profiles:
- name: interactive
  patches:
  - op: add
    path: dev.interactive
    value: 
      defaultEnabled: true
  - op: add
    path: dev.MY_IMAGE.entrypoint
    value:
    - sleep
    - 99999999
```

This profile can be activated via `-p interactive` and has the same functionality as using the flag `-i`.
:::

The development mode of DevSpace can be started using the `-i / --interactive` flag which overrides the `ENTRYPOINT` of an image with `[sleep, 999999]` and opens an interactive terminal session for one of the containers that use the 'sleeping' image. Due to the `ENTRYPOINT` override, the application has not been started within the container and the user can start the application manually through the interactive terminal session.

## Start Interactive Mode
Start the interactive mode using this command:
```bash
devspace dev -i
```
