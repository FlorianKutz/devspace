DevSpace allows you to define certain actions that should be executed during the pipeline. This makes it possible to customize the deployment and development process with DevSpace. The following actions can be executed with hooks:
- Execute a command on the local machine
- Execute a command in a container
- Upload a file or folder into a container
- Download a file or folder from a container
- Wait for a container to start or terminate
- Print the logs of container

Hooks can be defined in the `hooks` section of `devspace.yaml`:
```yaml
hooks:
- command: echo
  args:
    - before image building
  when:
    before:
      images: all
```

:::note Example Project
For a complete example take a look at [this example project on GitHub](https://github.com/loft-sh/devspace/tree/master/examples/hooks).
:::

This tells DevSpace to execute the command `echo before image building` before any image will be built. You are able to define hooks for the following life cycle events that can be triggered either before (`when.before`) or after (`when.after`) the event:
- **pull secret creation**: Will be executed before or after creating any image pull secrets. Example: `when.before.pullSecrets: all`
- **dependency deployment**: Will be executed before or after deploying any dependencies. Example: `when.before.dependencies: all`
- **image building**: Will be executed before or after building any images. Example: `when.before.images: all`
- **specific image build**: Will be executed before or after a certain image is built. The hook `when.after.images: my-image` is only executed if the image actually was built and not skipped. Example: `when.before.images: my-image`
- **deploying**: Will be executed before or after any deployment is deployed. Example: `when.before.deployments: all`
- **specific deployment**: Will be executed before or after a certain deployment is deployed. The hook `when.after.deployments: my-deployment` is only executed if the deployment was actually deployed and not skipped. Example: `when.before.deployments: my-deployment`
- **deployment purging**: Will be executed before or after any deployment is purged. Example: `when.before.purgeDeployments: all`
- **specific deployment purging**: Will be executed before or after a certain deployment is purged. Example: `when.before.purgeDeployments: my-deployment`

:::info Errors in Hooks
If any hook returns a non zero exit code, DevSpace will abort and print an error message.
:::

## Execute hooks if an error occured

DevSpace allows you to execute hooks after certain steps have failed:
- **pull secret creation**: Will be executed if creating image pull secrets fails. Value: `when.onError.pullSecrets: all`
- **dependency deployment**: Will be executed if deploying any dependencies fail. Value: `when.onError.dependencies: all`
- **image building**: Will be executed if building any images fails. Value: `when.onError.images: all`
- **deploying**: Will be executed if any deployment fails. Value: `when.onError.deployments: all`
- **certain deployment**: Will be executed if a certain deployment fails.  Value: `when.onError.deployments: my-deployment`

The actual error will be passed to the hook via the environment variable `DEVSPACE_HOOK_ERROR`. For example:
```yaml
# This will print the error to the console that has occured during a deployment
hooks:
- command: "sh"
  os: linux,darwin
  args: 
  - -c
  - 'echo "The following error has occured: $DEVSPACE_HOOK_ERROR"'
  when:
    onError:
      deployments: all
```

## Execute hooks in a container

DevSpace allows you to execute commands directly in a container instead of the local system. You can specify this in the `where` section of the hook:

```yaml
...
hooks:
- command: "echo"
  args: ["Hello from within the container!"]
  where: 
    container:
      imageName: default
      # Or select via labelSelector etc.
      # labelSelector: ...
      # namespace: ...
      # containerName: ...
      # pod: ...
  when:
    after:
      deployments: my-deployment
...
```

By default, DevSpace will wait for all pods / containers that were selected with the given selector to come up. As soon as all targets are running, DevSpace will execute the hook and wait for it to finish. You can define if DevSpace should wait and how long it should wait with `wait` and `timeout`:

```yaml
...
hooks:
- command: "echo"
  args: ["Hello from within the container!"]
  where: 
    container:
      imageName: default
      # Or select via labelSelector etc.
      # labelSelector: ...
      # namespace: ...
      # containerName: ...
      # pod: ...
      wait: true   # This is the default
      timeout: 300 # Timeout in seconds
  when:
    after:
      deployments: my-deployment
...
```

## Upload or Download files from a container

Hooks can be used to upload or download files from a container. In the background, DevSpace will basically do a `kubectl cp` to the specified container. Example:
```yaml
hooks:
# Upload the complete local bin folder to the container path ./bin
- upload:
    localPath: bin
    containerPath: bin
  where:
    container:
      imageName: default
  when:
    after:
      deployments: deployment-1
# Download a single file from the container to the local path
- download:
    localPath: build/artifact.jar
    containerPath: /abs/path/build/artifact-test.jar
  where:
    container:
      imageName: java
  when:
    after:
      deployments: deployment-2
```

## Wait for a pod to be running

This hook action can be useful if you want to ensure a certain pod is running before you continue with the pipeline. An example configuration could look like this:
```yaml
...
deployments:
- name: my-database
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      ...
hooks:
# This hook will ensure that everytime the deployment
# my-database is deployed that DevSpace will wait until
# all pods and containers that match the labelSelector
# app.kubernetes.io/component: my-database are running
- wait:
    # DevSpace will wait for all containers that match the label selector below to become running. 
    # If there are init containers, make sure to set terminatedWithCode as well.
    running: true
    # This can be needed if there are for example init containers
    # that terminate instead of become running.
    terminatedWithCode: 0
  where:
    container:
      labelSelector:
        app.kubernetes.io/component: my-database
        # You could also select just a specific container with
        # containerName: database-container
  when:
    after:
      deployments: my-database
...
```

## Print the logs of a container 

This action can be useful to print logs of jobs or print the logs of init containers that would not be printed otherwise during `devspace dev`. An example configuration could look like this:

`job.yaml`:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/component: my-job
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  containers:
    - command: ["sh"]
      args: ["-c", "echo 'Job Start' && sleep 5 && echo 'Doing Things...' && sleep 5 && echo 'Job End'"]
      image: alpine
      name: job
```

`devspace.yaml`:
```yaml
version: ...
deployments:
- name: my-job
  kubectl:
    manifests:
    - job.yaml
hooks:
# This hook will wait until the selected container is either running or already  
# terminated and then print the logs of it until it terminates.
- logs: {}
  where:
    container:
      labelSelector:
        app.kubernetes.io/component: my-job
  when:
    after:
      deployments: my-job
```

## Execute hooks in the background

By default, DevSpace will wait for a hook to finish and then move on with the pipeline. However, in some cases it might be desired that a hook is executed in the background to speed up a process. You can specify a background hook with the `background` option:

```yaml
...
hooks:
- command: "sh"
  args: ["-c", "sleep 10 && echo 'Hello, I was run inside the background!'"]
  background: true
  when:
    after:
      deployments: all
...
```

If you do not want to stream the output of the hook to the console, you can also mark the hook as silent, which will prevent any hook output:
```yaml
...
hooks:
- command: "sh"
  args: ["-c", "sleep 10 && echo 'Hello, I was run inside the background!'"]
  background: true
  silent: true
  when:
    after:
      deployments: all
...
```

## Execute hooks only on certain operating systems

Hooks can be executed only on certain operating systems:

```yaml {5,12}
hooks:
- command: echo
  args:
    - before image building on windows
  os: windows
  when:
    before:
      images: all
- command: echo
  args:
    - before image building on mac and linux
  os: darwin,linux
  when:
    before:
      images: all
```

## Hook Context Information

DevSpace passes certain environment variables to the hook execution:
- **DEVSPACE_HOOK_KUBE_CONTEXT**: the name of the kube context that was used
- **DEVSPACE_HOOK_KUBE_NAMESPACE**: the name of the kube namespace that was used
- **DEVSPACE_HOOK_OS_ARGS**: json encoded os.Args that were used to call devspace
- **DEVSPACE_HOOK_ERROR**: if an error has occured contains the error string (only for onError hooks)
