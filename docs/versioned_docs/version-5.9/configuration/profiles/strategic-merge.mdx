Strategic Merge patches are a way to perform specific overrides to the configuration without having to create a completely separate config file.
They are very similar to [merge patches](../../configuration/profiles/merge.mdx) and [kubernetes strategic patches](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/update-api-object-kubectl-patch/#use-strategic-merge-patch-to-update-a-deployment-using-the-retainkeys-strategy) with the distinct difference that special keys will be merged differently as in a standard merge patch.
Especially changes to a single `deployment` are easier to realize with a strategic merge patch.  

### Example

Strategic Merge patches are ideal for reflecting changes between different environments, e.g. dev, staging and production.
```yaml {25-38}
images:
  backend:
    image: john/devbackend
  backend-debugger:
    image: john/debugger
deployments:
- name: backend
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      service:
        ports:
        - port: 3000
      containers:
      - image: john/devbackend
      - image: john/debugger
- name: untouched-deployment
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      containers:
      - image: untouched/deployment
profiles:
- name: production
  strategicMerge:
    images:
      # Change the backend image
      backend:
        image: john/prodbackend
      # Delete the backend-debugger image
      backend-debugger: null
    # Override backend deployment and leave others
    deployments:
    - name: backend
      helm:
        values:
          containers:
          - image: john/prodbackend
```
**Explanation:**  
- The above example defines 1 profile: `production`
- When using the profile `production`, the config is merged with the given strategic merge patch at `profiles[0].strategicMerge`.
- Strategic Merge patches follow the same rules as [merge patches](../../configuration/profiles/merge.mdx), but are merged for special keys differently:
  - Array items will mostly be merged instead of replaced (depends on the key). For example, if you define an `deployments` array in a strategic merge patch, the array items will be matched by `name` and added to the array instead of replacing the complete `deployments` section.
- The resulting config used in-memory when the profile `production` is used would look like this (you can check via `devspace print -p production`):

```yaml
# In-Memory Config After Applying Merge Patches For Profile `production`
images:
  backend:
    image: john/prodbackend
deployments:
- name: backend
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      containers:
      - image: john/prodbackend
      service:
        ports:
        - port: 3000
- name: untouched-deployment
  helm:
    componentChart: true
    values:
      containers:
      - image: untouched/deployment
```
