There are two types of file synchronzation processes:
- on-demand file sync using `devspace sync` and
- file synchronization during development mode using `devspace dev`. 


## Start On-Demand File Sync
To establish an on-demand file synchronization between your local computer and the containers running inside Kubernetes, use the following command:
```bash
devspace sync   # common flags: --local-path=./ --container-path=/app --no-watch --config=./devspace.yaml
```

## Configure File Sync
If you want to start file synchronization every time you run `devspace dev`, you can configure it within `devspace.yaml`.
