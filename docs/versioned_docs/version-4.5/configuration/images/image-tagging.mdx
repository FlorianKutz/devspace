title: Image Name & Tagging Schema
sidebar_label: image + tag
---

The `images` section in `devspace.yaml` is a map with keys representing the name of the image and values representing the image definition including `tag`, `dockerfile` etc.
```yaml
images:                             # map[string]struct | Images to be built and pushed
  image1:                           # string   | Name of the image
    image: dscr.io/username/image   # string   | Image repository and name 
    tag: v0.0.1                     # string   | Tagging schema
    dockerfile: ./Dockerfile        # string   | Relative path to the Dockerfile used for building (Default: ./Dockerfile)
    context: ./                     # string   | Relative path to the context used for building (Default: ./)
    createPullSecret: true          # bool     | Create a pull secret containing your Docker credentials (Default: false)
    build: ...                      # struct   | Build options for this image
  image2: ...
```

## `image` *Image Repository*
The `image` option expects a string containing the image repository including registry and image name. 

- Make sure you [authenticate with the image registry](../../configuration/images/basics.mdx#authentication-registry) before using in here.
- For Docker Hub images, do not specify a registry hostname and use just the image name instead (e.g. `mysql`, `my-docker-username/image`).

#### Example: Multiple Images
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
  frontend:
    image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
```
**Explanation:**
- The first image `backend` would be tagged as `appbackend:[TAG]` pushed to Docker Hub using the path `john` (which generally could be your Docker Hub username).
- The second image `frontend` would be tagged as `appfrontend:[TAG]` and pushed to `dscr.io` using the path `${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}` which is a [dynamic config variable](../../configuration/variables/basics.mdx) that resolves to your username in DevSpace Cloud. 

> See **[`images[*].tag` *Tagging Schema*](#tag-tagging-schema)** for details on how the image `[TAG]` would be set in this case.


## `tag` *Tagging Schema*
The `tag` option expects a string containing a custom tagging schema used to automatically tag images before pushing them to the registry. The tagging schema can contain [dynamic config variables](../../configuration/variables/basics.mdx). While you can define your own config variables, DevSpace provides a set of pre-defined variables. The most commonly used variables for tagging are:
- **DEVSPACE_RANDOM**: A random 6 character long string
- **DEVSPACE_TIMESTAMP** A unix timestamp when the config was loaded
- **DEVSPACE_GIT_COMMIT**: A short hash of the local repo's current git commit
- **DEVSPACE_USERNAME**: The username currently logged into DevSpace Cloud

> **Make sure tags are unique** when defining a custom tagging schema. Unique tags ensure that your application gets started with the newly built image instead of using an older, cached version. 
> 
> Therefore, it is highly recommended to either use `DEVSPACE_RANDOM` or `DEVSPACE_TIMESTAMP` as a suffix in your tagging schema (see [example below](#example-custom-tagging-schema)).

#### Default Value For `tag`
```yaml
tag: ${DEVSPACE_RANDOM}
```

#### Example: Custom Tagging Schema
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    tag: dev-${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}-backend-${DEVSPACE_GIT_COMMIT}-${DEVSPACE_RANDOM}
```
**Explanation:**  
The above example would generate tags such as `dev-john-backend-b6caf8a-Jak9i` which would result from concatenating the following substrings:
- `dev-` static string 
- `john` [DevSpace Cloud](https://devspace.cloud/docs/introduction) username
- `-backend-` static string 
- `b6caf8a` latest git commit hash on current local branch
- `-` static string
- `Jak9i` auto-generated random string
