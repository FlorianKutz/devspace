## `kaniko`
Using `kaniko` as build tool allows you to build images direclty inside your Kubernetes cluster without a Docker daemon. DevSpace simply starts a build pod and builds the image using `kaniko`.

:::note Automatic Cleanup
After the build process completes, the build pod started for the kaniko build process will be deleted again.
:::

To set `kaniko` as default build tool, use the following configuration:
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        cache: true
```

### `cache`
The `cache` option expects a boolean that states if kaniko should make use of layer caching by pulling the previously build image and using the layers of this image as cache.

#### Default Value For `cache`
```yaml
cache: true
```

#### Example: Building Images with kaniko
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        cache: true
  frontend:
    image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
    build:
      kaniko:
        cache: false
```
**Explanation:**  
- The first image `backend` would be built using kaniko and make use of the build cache.
- The second image `frontend` would be built using kaniko and **not** use the build cache.


### `snapshotMode`
The `snapshotMode` option expects a string that can have the following values:
- `full` tells kaniko to do a full filesystem snapshot
- `time` tells kaniko to do a filesystem snapshot based on `mtime` (default)

:::warning Limitations
One of the biggest limitations of the `time` mode is that kaniko might **miss** file metadata changes introduced by `RUN` statements, e.g. kaniko might skip a command such as `RUN chown 333:333 -R /app`. In cases where this is not an option, use `full` instead. Learn more about [limitations related to kaniko snapshots using `mtime`](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko#mtime-and-snapshotting).
:::

#### Default Value For `snapshotMode`
```yaml
snapshotMode: time
```

#### Example: Building Images with kaniko
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        cache: true
  frontend:
    image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/appfrontend
    build:
      kaniko:
        snapshotMode: time
```
**Explanation:**  
- The first image `backend` would be built using kaniko and creating full filesystem snapshots.
- The second image `frontend` would be built using kaniko and calculate filesystem snapthots only based on `mtime`.


### `flags`
The `flags` option expects an array of strings that will be passed as flags and values for these flags when running the kaniko build command.

:::note Kaniko Documentation
Take a look at the kaniko documentation for a full [list of available flags](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko#additional-flags).
:::

#### Default Value For `flags`
```yaml
flags: []
```

#### Example: Passing Flags to kaniko
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        flags:
        - --cache-dir
        - /tmp
        - --verbosity
        - debug
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using kaniko and the flags `--cache-dir=/tmp --verbosity=debug` would be set when running the build command within the kaniko pod used for image building.


### `namespace`
The `namespace` option expects a string stating a namespace that should be used to start the kaniko build pod in.

#### Default Value For `namespace`
```yaml
namespace: "" # defaults to the default namespace of the current kube-context
```

#### Example: Different Namespace For kaniko
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        namespace: build-namespace
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using kaniko and the build pod started to run the kaniko build process would be created within the namespace `build-namespace` within the cluster that the current kube-context points to.


### `insecure`
The `insecure` option expects a boolean stating if kaniko should allow to push to an insecure (plain HTTP instead of HTTPS) registry.

:::warning
This option should only be set to `true` for testing purposes.
:::

#### Default Value For `insecure`
```yaml
insecure: false
```

#### Example: Push to Insecure Registry With kaniko
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: 123.456.789.0:5000/john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        insecure: false
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using kaniko and pushing to the insecure registry `123.456.789.0:5000` would be allowed.


### `pullSecret`
The `pullSecret` option expects a string with the name of a Kubernetes secret which is used by kaniko as pull secret (e.g. for pulling the base image defined in the `FROM` statement of the Dockerfile).

:::info
In most cases, DevSpace already makes sure that kaniko gets the correct pull secrets to push and pull to registries.
:::

#### Default Value For `pullSecret`
```yaml
pullSecret: ""
```

#### Example: Pull Secret For kaniko
```yaml
images:
  backend:
    image: john/appbackend
    build:
      kaniko:
        pullSecret: custom-pull-secret
```
**Explanation:**  
The image `backend` would be built using kaniko and kaniko would use the Kubernete secret `custom-pull-secret` to pull images from registries that require authentication.


## `kaniko.options`
DevSpace allows you to configure the following build options:
- `target` defining the build target for multi-stage builds
- `network` to define which network to use during building (e.g. `docker build --network=host`)
- `buildArgs` to pass arguments to the Dockerfile during the build process


### `target`

<FragmentBuildOptionsTarget/>


### `network`

<FragmentBuildOptionsNetwork/>


### `buildArgs`
