import FragmentVarsName from '../../fragments/vars-name.mdx';
import FragmentVarsDefault from '../../fragments/vars-default.mdx';
import FragmentVarsForceString from '../../fragments/vars-force-string.mdx';

If the `source` is `command`, DevSpace will **<u>not</u>** ask the user a question and instead execute a command to determine the value of the variable.
```yaml {3,5-8}
images:
  database:
    image: "mysql:${MYSQL_VERSION}"
vars:
- name: MYSQL_VERSION
  source: command
  command: echo
  args: ["5.5"]
```

If you need different commands depending on the operating system you can use `commands`:
```yaml {3,7-10}
images:
  database:
    image: "mysql:${MYSQL_VERSION}"
vars:
- name: MYSQL_VERSION
  source: command
  commands:
  - command: bash
    args: ["-c", "echo '5.5'"]
    os: linux,darwin
  command: echo
  args: ["5.5"]
```

:::info
If not command for the current operating system can be found under `commands`, the `command` and `args` will be used as fallback.

<FragmentVarsForceString/>

## Configuration

### `name`

<FragmentVarsName/>


### `command` & `args`

The command and arguments to execute to retrieve the value of the variable. The captured stdout of the command will be used as variable value. Whitespaces and newlines will be trimmed from the command output.

### `commands`

Commands expects an array of objects that define commands for specific operating systems. If no command can be found for the current operating system in `commands`, then `command` will be used as fallback.

```yaml
vars:
- name: MYSQL_VERSION
  source: command
  commands:
  # Use command on linux
  - command: bash
    args: ["-c", "echo '5.5'"]
    os: linux
  # Use command on mac
  - command: bash
    args: ["-c", "echo '5.6'"]
    os: darwin
  # Use on all other operating systems
  command: echo
  args: ["5.5"]
```

### `default`

If the command returns nothing, this is the value that will be used for this variable.
